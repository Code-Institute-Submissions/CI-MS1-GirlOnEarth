## 1. About


GirlOnEarth. is a website created for a meet-up group. The purpose of the group is to gathering like-minded female individuals sharing the same values and metaphors about life, empowering each other to live their life to the maximum to dream big and trive! 

I have moved to Ireland since the age of 20, ever since then I have been busy surving, studying and working, having a family and raising kids, it has been non-stop. Until March last year, Covid happened, it forced us to pause, until then I finally relized that I haven't been busy living, my mind wasn't on how to live my life - the once and only! Ever since then my focus was shifted onto self-improvement, empowering mindset, mindfulness... Having been working as a beautician for many years, it defines part of me. And being a mother is a major role of my life. And the relationship struggles! It certainly created the ups and downs over the years! 

So, there you go! I came up with this idea for my Milestone project 1 for the full stack web development course at [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).

## 2. Users Experience (UX)


#### 2.1 Users stories

As a high value woman, I want to live my life the maximum by surrounding myself with inspiring metaphors shared by like-minded individuals, so that I can live my life to the maximum aligned with my passions and desire.
As a user I am looking for insparations, new ideas, interesting topics, uplifting spirits.
As a user I am looking for like-minded people to hang-out with, make friends with, and empowering each other.
As a user I am looking for interesting acitivities I can join in to spice up my free time.

#### 2.2 The Five Planes of UX

* ##### Strategy Plane

  **The aim** is to attract the like-minded women join the group with their own insparations to add value to the group, so the group can grow and inspire more and more women to create a more sustainable lifestyle for themselves, so that the world will become a better place.

  **The target audience** is female individuals that have a strong mindset, knowing what they want to achieve in life and aiming to live their life to the maxmium.

* ##### Scope Plane

  **The home page** should include an eye catching feature with an insparational metaphors to draw users attendation immediately. **The passions section** should include a few of the topics around daily life would interest our female audience. It would be ideal if there are acticles could be linked to this section, but for now the page can be just inclule a basic scope, it can be added as the page grows. **The Event** section should be divided into 3 columns, with a round shape image clearly tell the users what is happening on a regular basis. **The contact page** should include a form so that the user can get in touch with us.

* ##### Structure Plane
  
  The page is going to a single page with four sections, with a header containers a brand image, a brand name and a navigatiion bar. The home page section structured on the top of the page, followed by an about section clarify what's this page is about. The a big section divided by four individual topics staggered across the entire page with images. Finally there is a contact form for the useers to fill up if they are interested to join in the group. Close the page with a footer has social links and copyright informaton, also another links for the contact form.

* ##### Skeleton Plane
  The goal is to achieve a clean visual effect with the entire page with as less text as possible, using simple and calming images to deliver the "go with the flow" effect. The navigatiion system should be simple and clear, with four sections fixed on the top of the page, when the users click, it will bring them straight to the relavant sectiion. Please see the wireframes in the Mockups section.

* ##### Surface Plane
  Becasue of our audience is female individuals, our color theme will be light and girly, images should be feminine, fonts will also be delicate. Minimise the content is the goal, to create a calming sensation throughout the page.

## 4. Features

#### 4.1 Existing Features
The site is a one-page site divided by five sections, include *home*, *about*, *passions*, *acitivities*, and *contact*. The layout of the page also completed by its responsive navbar, footer and two dividers to ensure a balanced visual effect.
#### Navbar
The responsive navbar has been achieved by Implementing bootstrap 4, it collapes into a button when the screen smaller than 990px. It contains links to all sections, and the logo of the page. The logo also used as a homepage link.
#### Homepage
The homepage contains a main image, a title quote and a button. I used CSS animation to make the quote sliding from left to right as soon as the page is loading, then the button "starts now" appears 2 second later. The aim here is to grab users' attendation, make the site appealing.
#### About
The about section contains two images and the a paragraph describing what the page is all about, so the users can have a clear view of what they can get from using the page. The section's visual effect is achieved by using CSS position and overflow.
#### Passions 
This section contains 6 images and a title with a quote,  explaining what topics the group is focusing on, gives the user a general idea about the passions what we might have in common. I used CSS grid to make this section completely responsive for all different screen sizes.
#### Acitivities
This section gives the user an idea about what acitivities we are going to do together to reach our goals. It contains 3 small sections with an image and time and place each event is happening. 
#### Contact
The contact section contains a form, which gathering users informaton, includes users' first and last name, email address and a text field for them to leave a message. A submit button is also included. Although at the moment, there's no backend attached to the site, but by the time I finish this course, I would be able to Implement such feature.
#### Dividers
There are two individual dividers divides the page into sections, inside the divider, there's a motivational quote.
#### Footer
The footer has been divided into three sections, which is contact link, social icons links and copyright. 

#### 4.2 Features Left to Implement
As the course progress, I would love to add additional features to this page, for example, adding intereting acticles and links into each passions, subscribe users onto email list. so whenever there's an update on the page or new articles, they will be notified. All the backend features will be Implemented by the time I finished this course, such as users' informaton etc.
